# [excursion](https://jamesllllllllll.github.io/excursion/)

In this project, I'm learning how to use Git Bash to:
1. Create directories and files for a repository
2. Initialize a local repository in the main working directory
3. Commit changes
4. [Create the repository on github.com (not Git Bash)]
5. Push commits to public repository using Git Bash
